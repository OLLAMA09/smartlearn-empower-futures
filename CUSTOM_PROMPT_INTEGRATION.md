# 🎯 Custom Prompt Integration for Netlify Free Plan

## ✅ Your Custom Prompt is Now Fully Supported!

Your detailed custom prompt:
```
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Content Analysis: First, identify and extract key concepts from each content section and subtitle within the course material
2. Section-Based Questions: Create {numQuestions} multiple-choice questions, ensuring questions are distributed across different course sections and subtitles
3. Question Attribution: Each question should:
   - Reference the specific course section/subtitle it's testing
   - Focus on important concepts from that particular section
   - Test comprehension rather than memorization
4. Answer Structure: Include 4 answer options for each question with only one correct answer
5. Detailed Explanations: Provide comprehensive explanations that:
   - Explain why the correct answer is right
   - Reference the specific course section/subtitle where the concept was covered
   - Briefly explain why incorrect options are wrong
```
